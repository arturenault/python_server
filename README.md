Python Server
=============

This is a really basic server in Python. Uses the sockets module.

Based off of Jae's advanced programming class's Lab7.

Made with help from [this](http://python.about.com/od/networkingwithpython/ss/PythonWebServer.htm) tutorial.

I just did it to learn Python a bit better. I'll probably keep improving it to improve network skills.
